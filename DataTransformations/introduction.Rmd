# Workshop Overview
  -  The pipe: `%>%` (Ceci n'est pas une pipe)
  - Selecting: `select()`
  - Filtering: `filter()`
  - Creating Columns: `mutate()`
  - Aggregating: `group_by()`
  - Aggregate summary: `summarise()`

## Tidy Data

## The Pipe

The pipe is fundamental a tidy data workflow. As a bit of background, the pipe was first implemented in Hadley Wickham's package `magrittr`. The package's sole purpose was to introduce the pipe operator to chain commands together. The pipe (`%>%`) sends a value forward into a function call.

The name `magrittr` comes from the famous surrealist painting from **Rene Magritte** as seen below.

Hadley's cleverness is embodied by the below picture.

The pipe (`%>%`) makes the value that you *piped forward* the first argument within a function call. If the piped value isn't the first argument, you can use `.` to represent those data (this is a lot easier than typing the same value name over and over).

As an example, we can use a function that we know well and usually only takes 1 argument: `head()`. `head()` is used to preview the first 6 rows of data.

Let's try this with some new data in the newest release of `dplyr`.

```{r}
starwars %>%
  head()
```
