## Download R & RStudio
R and RStudio are free to download. Google them, download, and install them. Then open up RStudio.

First install R:
<ol type = "1">
  <li>Go to <a href="https://cran.r-project.org">https://cran.r-project.org</a>.</li>
  <li>Click "Download for R for [Your Operating System]".</li>
  <li>Click "base" under "Subdirectories".</li>
  <li>Click "Download R 3.x.0 for [Your Operating System] and save the file".</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder that contains the installation file. </li>
  <li>Double-click the installation file and follow the directions.</li>
</ol>

Now install RStudio:  
<ol type = "1">
  <li>Go to <a href="https://www.rstudio.com">https://www.rstudio.com</a>.</li>
  <li>Scroll down the website and click the "Download" tab under the RStudio Logo.</li>
  <li>Scroll down and download the "RStudio Desktop - Open Source License". <i>*<b>Note</b>: This file should be free to use.</i></li>
  <li>Click the the link and download the installer file: "Rstudio 1.0.xxx - [Your Operating System]".</li>
  <li>Navigate to the folder that contains the installation file.</li>
  <li>Double-click the installation file and follow the directions.</li>
</ol>


## The IDE
IDE stands for integrated development environment. One of the best things about R is that the community has converged on using one IDE and that is RStudio. There are some other options (e.g. vim and VisualStudio) but the vast majority of folks use RStudio. 

For those uninitiated with IDEs, it will be where you write, run, and test R code. There's a number of other features that make it convenient for development but these are the core aspects.

To create a script, File > New File > R Script. Wa-lah! You have your first R script. Pretty boring at first but it will soon be filled with objects and functions that make nice visualizations or analyses for your data.


Also, it won't look exactly like the gifs above. I have also changed the color theme. To do this, go to Tools > Global Options > Appearance. In the Appearance pane, you'll have a few options. I've set my theme to VibrantInk.


## Creating Objects & Running Code
To get in a cood habit of using the IDE, we'll write our code in the text editor portion of the IDE and then run it down in the console. This will save you a lot of headache compared to simply writing code down in the console and running the code.

To start, let's create an object 'x' which is an array of numbers.
```{r}
x <- c(4, 5, 2, 7, 8, 9, 1)
x
```

Awesome! We just created an object! It seems pretty uneventful at the moment but this is a huge step towards effectively working with data in R. There's a few things to point out here about x. First, we created it by setting it equal to an array of numbers which we're concatenated (by c). It is an interpretted language, meaning we didn't have to specify the data type beforehand.

I called this object 'x'. Stylistically, this is not the best name for a variable. Typically, you want to call it something more informative like 'price' or 'weight'. For this example, though, we'll just keep it as 'x' for simplicity. Getting into style is beyond the scope of this tutorial, if you'd like to learn more about style -- Google has put together a nice guide on <a href="http://google.github.io/styleguide/Rguide.xml">how to style your R code</a>.

Next, I used an equal sign to assign the array to the object. Admittedly, the R community prefers using '<-' instead. For many common cases, they work similarly. However, they are different in their scope, as shown in these examples <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1741820/assignment-operators-in-r-and">here</a>.


## Dataframes
Dataframes are the bread and butter of working with data in R. There's a universe of tools for working with this kind of data (i.e. see the <a href="">tidyverse</a>). When developing in R, you typically want to be working with dataframes because of their flexibility. They're so important, I'm going to dedicate the whole next section to working with data frames.

## Plotting


## Functions
Base R comes with a lot of functions. For example, if you wanted to create a linear model it's as simple as running the 'lm' command with the appropriate parameter entries.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
